## Descriptive Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to provide a sense of data. Here you will be seeing lots of summary of various variables.

We will begin the analysis by calling following packages in R:

```{r Packages}
library(foreign)
library(dplyr)
```

<h1 style="red:blue;font-size:22px;">

My Styled Heading

</h1>

Next, we will also setup the directory so that our work would stay at one place & for R it would be easier to get data:

```{r setwd}
setwd("/Users/sulailfatima/Desktop/Megasync/transgenderdata")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
